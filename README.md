# GitHub-replica
This project is a replica of GitHub's main page for an online course provided in the website Pirple-com.

In this final project I used a lot of the general HTML tags to create lists, list elements, paragraphs, forms, meta data, navs, header, etc.

Through out the execution of this project I used a Flex-box most of the times as a way of displaying each of the sections in which the HTML's body was divided.

My approach to the styling in the external cascading style sheet was to give an ID to each section (Naming the sections) and dealing with them separately one by one. I focused on one section at a time and when it looked fairly similar to the original website I proceeded to mov to the next one.
