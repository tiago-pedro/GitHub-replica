# GitHub-replica
This project is a replica of GitHub's main page for an online course provided in the website Pirple-com.

In this final project I learned how to structure a website from scratch writting the whole code in raw HTML. I used a lot of the different HTML tags I learned along the course and with the help of some research I was able to replicate a professionally made website despite of some different, more complicated aspects.

Here are some of the HTML tags that where used in the code for this website:

<ul>
  <li>Unordered list</li>
  <li>list elements</li>
  <li>paragraphs</li>
  <li>forms</li>
  <li>meta data</li>
  <li>navs</li>
  <li>header</li>
  <li>span elements</li>
  <li>'i' graphical elements</li>
</ul>

Through out the execution of this project I used a **Flex-box** most of the times as a way of displaying each of the *sections* in which the HTML's body was divided.

My approach to the styling in the external **cascading style sheet** was to give an ID to each section (Naming the sections) and dealing with them separately one by one. I focused on one section at a time and when it looked fairly similar to the original website I proceeded to mov to the next one.

<strong>The code presented in this repository is only used for academic purposes and has by no means the intention to serve has a thrid party website to redirect people to a fake *GitHub* page</strong>.

This is an academic project only.
